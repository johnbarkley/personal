                        , a company that develops timing products for various types of sporting events. I developed
                        a C# application using Windows Forms that reads and handles the results of a race in real-time and
                        allows for display on an LED screen on-site. It consists of an operator window, a display window, and a
                        configurations menu allowing for customization of the display.</p>
                        <p>In the process of developing the application, I learned about multi-threading and engaging with the file
                        system, among other concepts, and became comfortable with C#. I was also able to use the opportunity to improve
                        my Spanish (including learning a variety of coding-related terms!), as the entire office was Spanish-speaking.
