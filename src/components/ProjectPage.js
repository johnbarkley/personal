                            <p>Mockupp is a tool built with React for creating browser-style mockups for presentations and portfolios. You upload your design and can customize the browser appearance and background. The app is in its early stages of development - Iâ€™m aware that there are bugs that exist and Iâ€™m currently working on fixing them as well as adding new features.</p>
                            <p>I built Mockupp after spending a lot of time on sites like Dribbble where the majority of users showcase their site designs in a mockup browser with a drop shadow and on top of a solid background or a simple pattern. Although itâ€™s a relatively quick process to create such a mockup in Figma, Sketch, or another design software, I wanted to create an app that allowed for such a presentation in seconds. In addition, it also allows more amateur designers and developers (like myself) to present their work in a manner that looks more professional. These mockups can be used in a personal portfolio, on showcase sites like Dribbble or Behance, or even in a presentation in a professional setting (although I canâ€™t say Iâ€™ve done it yet myself <span role='img' aria-label='wink'>ðŸ˜‰</span>). I wanted to add features that would improve the presentation of the design and have some more ideas in mind (details below).</p>

                            <p style={{fontStyle:'italic'}}>Updates will be added below as I progress with the design & development.</p>
                            <p>The idea for Throww came to me as I worked on frontend projects over the last year or so. For every project, I always had dozens of open tabs of different sites, images, fonts, and colors to get ideas and inspiration for my design. I realized that having a tool where I could store all of my different sources of inspiration in one place and manage them by project would be very useful in the design and development process. Up until now, Iâ€™ve just used notes with links, text, and occasionally images, and I think that having a web app where you can create a new project, upload your different sources of inspiration, and have them handled automatically and presented in a way thatâ€™s easy to iterate over and draw from would expedite and improve the process.</p>
                            <p>The name comes from the concept of a moodboard, of sorts, as a place to organize your inspiration for a project, and the action of "throwing" something new onto the board (and of course one 'w' wouldnâ€™t be available!).</p>

                            <p>Iâ€™m currently designing the project and board interfaces and have done some preliminary/static development in React. I hope to launch towards the end of this fall.</p>
                            <p>Current plan for features/items that can be 'thrown' are:</p>

                            <li>Fonts (upload via Google Fonts, formatted & displayed with editable dummy text)</li>

                        <TextBlock>
                            <p>In my internship this past summer, although I worked on a team of only a few people, I realized the importance of communication and coordination between team members. I also began to appreciate the value of a task manager to facilitate the development process of a larger project. In the office, we used a white board and sticky notes, and for my own work I kept a text file with a list of my various tasks. Although this system was functional, I felt like it could be improved upon with a better tool.</p>
                            <p>Of course, there are a multitude of sophisticated project management tools available as well as simpler to-do list-type applications, but I wanted to give my own design a shot to see what I could come up with.</p>
                            <p>The task manager I designed is meant to serve as a collaborative planning & management tool for a team working on the same product or project. My two main focuses were <span id='bold-num'>(1)</span> developing a hierarchical structure that is easy to rearrange and manipulate and <span id='bold-num'>(2)</span> emphasizing the collaborative nature and features of the tool.</p>
                        </TextBlock>
                        <img src={tasksInterface} alt='tasks interface' />

                        <h6 className='project-page-title'>Hierarchical structure</h6>
                        <TextBlock>
                            <p>I wanted to support the implementation of a hierarchical task structure, meaning users can break a task up into multiple subtasks. This was something that I always did in my text file over the summer, albeit with indentation. In this regard, I wanted to have a clear and evident visual cue that displayed the task structure. As such, subtasks are indented significantly and are also made up of thinner bars, thus reflecting their relationship to the parent.</p>
                            <p>Another aspect of the hierarchical structure that I wanted to facilitate was the manipulation and rearrangement of the task bars. I wanted to design a structure that was easy to rearrange via drag-and-drop, which is why I picked bars instead of simple items without any visible container.</p>
                        </TextBlock>
                        <img src={tasksZoom} alt='tasks zoom' style={imageCenter}  />

                        <h6 className='project-page-title'>Collaboration & communication</h6>
                        <TextBlock>
                            <p>I wanted to facilitate collaboration and coordination between team members in the following ways:</p>
                        </TextBlock>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Establish the creator/leader of the task - seen on the right side of a task bar. Leaders can be assigned to subtasks as well.</li>
                            <li>Define participants in the specific task - click + to show youâ€™re joining a task. Then, the green check stands out from the primarily white elements to draw the user to their personal tasks. The icon and number tell you how many team members are currently working on a given task.</li>
                            <li>Emphasize a userâ€™s status as a member of their team - profile section on left sidebar set up in a structural nature with the personal profile below that of the team.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <img src={taskNotJoined} alt='Task not joined' style={imageCenter} />
                        <img src={taskJoined} alt='Task joined' style={imageCenter} />

                        <h6 className='project-page-title'>Other features, explained</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Deadline in blue - central part of a task so wanted it to stand out from the other information on a task bar. Changing this color to red on the day of the deadline, or within a certain hour threshold would be a good addition to further make the deadline stand out.</li>
                            <li>Completed tasks - I didnâ€™t want to get rid of the completed tasks right away, in case you need to go back and review something. This is why they are muted but not overwhelmingly so, or gotten rid of entirely. In a fully developed version, I imagine a feature in the three-dot menu next to the task list title that would allow clearing of completed tasks</li>
                            <li>Percent completion - lets the user know with a quick look how a task split into subtasks is progressing. This is especially useful when subtasks are hidden.</li>
                            <li>Show/hide subtasks arrow - part of hierarchical structure.</li>
                            <li>Three-dot menu - some features I would imagine in this menu button are clearing completed tasks as mentioned above and filtering tasks by your participation (i.e. show those which you are a member of) as well as basic functionality like editing the task list title and deleting it.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <p>This was a relatively quick project, and is a slightly abbreviated version of edX's course listing page. However, I also made some deliberate choices to leave out features that they have included in their current design.</p>
                            <p>The main feeling I got in scrolling through the current site was that it was just very crowded and busy, so I focused on remedying this in my redesign. To do so, I made the following design choices:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Spaced out the navbar by moving items to the edges and decreasing font size.</li>
                                <li>Removed the hero image between the title and gave it more space above and below. I think a hero image could be implemented in an attractive way but there are already a lot of images below with the course thumbnails and I really wanted there to be more whitespace on the screen.</li>
                                <li>Removed the two large "View all edX Courses" buttons as well as the additional search bar at the end of the results.</li>
                                <li>I also removed the description text "EdX offers free online architecture..." from the initial view, and would plan to display it under a "More info"-type toggle button in the header section.</li>
                                <li>I also like the idea of the navigation text ("Home > All Subjects > Architecture"), especially when you click on a course to allow for really well-structured navigation but didn't implement it in this design.</li>
                                <li>Made each course card a bit smaller and spread them out more so they don't feel so cramped.</li>
                                <li>Toned down the 'verified' tag because it took up quite a bit of space on the card and in going through edX's courses it seems like the vast majority are verified, so it's not differentiating a lot as it is anyways. My version of the tag might even be a bit too much, and could be toned down with a darker green, or just changed to a check mark instead of the full word.</li>
                                <li>I wanted to make the hover state a bit cleaner, so I defined it as the blue highlight of the course title and the underline (you can see it on result 2). I think it could be a bit stronger, though.</li>
                                <li>Removed the 'Explore other edX subject areas' and 'Explore in other ways' links after the courses. It felt like a lot to squeeze in above the footer and would be better solved by a 'Back to top' button. I also think a fixed navbar could work, especially because courses continue to load as you scroll and with subjects with more courses than architecture you end up with a really long page.</li>
                                <li>With the footer, I wanted to give the different elements and lists more space, so I made it taller and also picked the white on black to create a strong contrast that I felt helped bring some more clarity to it as well.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>A few other notes:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The hover state is shown on result 2, with the blue highlight of the course title and the underline.</li>
                                <li>I made up the "NEW" tag just as an idea, but there are others that could function as well in place of "VERIFIED", like Professional Certificate Program/XSeries Program for example.</li>
                                <li>I picked GT America as the font and thought it turned out really well with this design!</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>I enjoyed designing this page so I might give it a go building it out as well!</p>
                        </TextBlock>

            )
            break
        default:
            break
    }

    return (
        <div>
            {content}
        </div>
    )
